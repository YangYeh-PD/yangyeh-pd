## ðŸ”­ Experience
### Firmware Developer @ NCKU
*Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2023*  
- Designed, analyzed, and implemented digital infrared sensor circuits for educational teaching aids featured at a Physics Education Science Fair. 
Responsibilities included soldering components, creating custom laser-cut enclosures, and performing circuit safety tests with laboratory 
equipment.
- Collaborated with the design team to develop and maintain Arduino programs in C++ to ensure accuracy and reliability, contributing to a 
successful exhibition.

### Research Assistant @ NCKU
*Sep. 2020 - Feb. 2021*
- Designed, developed, and optimized Python web crawlers using Selenium to automate the extraction of air pollution data from NASA's online 
databases. Enhanced data collection efficiency and reliability by implementing robust error-handling mechanisms and scheduling features for 
regular updates.
- Used Stata and regression methods to analyze more than 300 million data points to investigate the relationship between childrenâ€™s IQ and PM2.5 
index in Africa.

## âš¡Extracurricular Activities
### Project Leader, Algorithm Visualization @ GDSC
*Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2023*
